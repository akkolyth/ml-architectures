Welcome to the ML Architectures Lab blog! 🎉

This blog documents our journey implementing various machine learning architectures from scratch. Our goal is to understand these models deeply by building them ourselves.

## What to Expect

In this blog, we'll cover:

- **Architecture deep-dives** - Understanding the theory behind popular models
- **Implementation guides** - Step-by-step code walkthroughs
- **Experiments** - Training runs, ablations, and insights

## First Up: CLIP

We're starting with OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model. CLIP learns to connect images and text in a shared embedding space, enabling powerful zero-shot classification capabilities.

Stay tuned for our first technical post!

*Happy learning!*
